# Oozaru: Sphere for the Web

**Oozaru** is a lightweight implementation of the
[Sphere](https://github.com/fatcerberus/sphere) game engine for the Web,
written entirely in TypeScript and based only on existing HTML and JavaScript
technologies; no third-party browser plugin is required and the engine runs
out of the box on all mainstream browsers.

While Oozaru is currently an incomplete implementation of the Sphere API, it
remains in active development and is planned to be fully integrated into the
official Sphere toolchain once API parity has been achieved.

## Download

Oozaru is still in early development so there are no downloads yet. Stay tuned!

## About the Project

### The Name üêí

"Oozaru" is the Japanese name for the Saiyans' Great Ape transformation from
Dragon Ball Z, and follows in a long tradition of Sphere v2-related projects
being named for Dragon Ball concepts, joining the ranks of **Cell**, the Sphere
compiler; and **SSj**, the Sphere debugger.

### Goal ‚úî

The goal of the Oozaru project is to develop a lightweight browser-based game
engine which is based on established Web and JavaScript technologies wherever
possible.  The engine should be fully usable in a reasonably modern browser
without the user having to install external plugins or extensions, and it
should also be possible to write JavaScript code which will execute in both
Oozaru and [neoSphere](https://github.com/fatcerberus/sphere) without
modifications.

### License üìú

Like the rest of the Sphere platform, Oozaru is licensed under the terms of a
BSD-3-clause license. The engine can be used for any purpose, even
commercially, with no other requirements except to maintain the accompanying
copyright notice and license text.
