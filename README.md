# Oozaru: Sphere for the Web

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/spheredev/oozaru.svg)](https://github.com/spheredev/oozaru/releases/latest)

**Oozaru** is a lightweight implementation of the
[Sphere](https://github.com/spheredev/neosphere) game engine API for the Web,
written purely in JavaScript and based on standard HTML and JavaScript
technologies; the engine is designed to run out-of-the-box in most modern
browsers with no required build step.

Oozaru is currently in beta, but will eventually be fully integrated
into the official Sphere development toolchain.


## Download

Oozaru is available for download from the GitHub repository's Releases page,
which can be found here:

* https://github.com/spheredev/oozaru/releases

Oozaru is still in beta and doesn't yet support the full Sphere v2 API; as a
result, it won't run all Sphere v2 games yet and glitches may occur.  Overall
support should be pretty high, though; if you find any bugs or missing
features, please report them!


## About the Project

### The Name üêí

"Oozaru" is the Japanese name for the Saiyans' Great Ape transformation from
Dragon Ball Z, and follows in a long tradition of Sphere v2-related projects
being named for Dragon Ball concepts, joining the likes of **Cell**, the Sphere
compiler; and **SSj**, the Sphere debugger.

### Goal ‚úî

The goal of the Oozaru project is to develop a lightweight browser-based game
engine which is built on established Web and JavaScript technologies.  It is
intended that the engine be fully functional in a modern browser without the
user having to install external plugins or extensions, and it should also be
possible to write JavaScript code which will execute in both Oozaru and
[neoSphere](https://github.com/fatcerberus/sphere) without modification.

### License üìú

Like the rest of the Sphere platform, Oozaru is licensed under the terms of a
BSD-style license. The engine can be used for any purpose, even commercially,
with no other requirements except to maintain the accompanying copyright notice
and license text.
