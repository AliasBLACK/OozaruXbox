Oozaru [WIP]
============

An implementation of the **Sphere v2 API** for the Web.  The goal of this
project is to make a lightweight browser-based game engine based on established
technologies wherever possible, but which is nonetheless code-compatible with a
full minisphere client.

"Oozaru" is the original Japanese name for the "Great Ape" transformation in
Dragon Ball Z, and follows in a long tradition of Sphere v2-related projects
being named after DBZ concepts.
