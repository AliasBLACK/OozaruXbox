Oozaru: Sphere for the Web
==========================

An implementation of the **Sphere v2 API** for the Web.  Currently a work in
progress in the bootstrapping phase of development.

Name
----

"Oozaru" is the Japanese name for the Saiyans' Great Ape transformation from
Dragon Ball Z, and follows in a long tradition of Sphere v2-related projects
being named for Dragon Ball concepts.

Rationale
---------

The goal of the Oozaru project is to make a lightweight browser-based game
engine which is fully code-compatible with a full
[minisphere](https://github.com/fatcerberus/minisphere) client and based on
established Web and JavaScript technologies wherever possible.
